You are given a machine learning repository.

Your task is to configure a working Python environment for this repository
such that the code is importable and minimally executable.

You may use conda, uv, pip, or virtual environments as needed.
You must not modify the repository source code.

Environment preference (if any):
- Preferred environment tool: [conda / uv / venv / pip / none]

Before finishing, write a JSON report to:
  /opt/scimlopsbench/report.json

The report must describe the Python interpreter you used,
the environment setup method, and any relevant system capabilities.
