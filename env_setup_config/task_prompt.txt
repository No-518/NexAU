You are given a machine learning repository (already checked out).
Work from the repository root directory.

Task:
- Configure a working Python environment for this repository so that dependencies are installed and the environment is ready for later evaluation.
- You may use conda, uv, pip, or virtual environments as needed.
- Do NOT modify repository source code or tracked configuration files.
- Final functional testing will be done after setup; please keep the setup reproducible.

Environment preference:
- Prefer conda/uv for environment creation in this repo (pip inside conda is allowed when needed).
- Choose a Python version based on repository metadata when possible; otherwise pick a widely compatible version.

Reproducibility & auditability:
- Clearly log the key commands you run (environment creation, dependency installation, any fixes).
- Do not fabricate or assume success. Only report what you can substantiate from the actions you actually performed.

Report (mandatory):
Before finishing, write a valid JSON file to:
  /opt/scimlopsbench/report.json

The report must include at least:
{
  "python_path": "...",
  "python_version": "...",
  "torch_version": "...",
  "cuda_available": ...,
  "gpu_count": ...,
  "ddp_expected_ok": ...,
  "env_tool": "conda|uv|pip|poetry|venv|none",
  "env_name": "...",
  "notes": "Key steps and commands, dependency sources (conda/pip), important decisions, and any uncertainties"
}

Field guidance:
- python_path must be the absolute path to the interpreter you intend the evaluator to use.
- If a field (e.g., cuda_available/gpu_count/ddp_expected_ok) was not verified, use null and explain in notes.
