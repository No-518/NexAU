You are given a machine learning repository (already checked out).
Work from the repository root directory.

Goal:
- Configure a working Python environment such that the repository code is importable
  and minimally executable (smoke-level).
- Do NOT modify repository source code or tracked configuration files.

Allowed tools:
- You MAY use conda/mamba/micromamba, pip, uv, or venv as needed.
- Preferred environment tool: conda (must try first).
- You MAY install system packages via apt only if strictly required for build/runtime stability.

Critical requirement:
- At the end, there must be ONE python interpreter that you explicitly choose and validate.
- All evaluation will use ONLY the python interpreter you report in python_path.

Required validation steps (must be executed and reflected in notes):
1) Print python path and version:
   - which python
   - python --version
2) Dependency/import smoke test:
   - python -c "import <REPO_IMPORT_TARGET>; print('import_ok')"
   (If unknown, find a reasonable import target by inspecting packaging metadata.)
3) If PyTorch is installed or relevant:
   - python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__); print(torch.cuda.is_available()); print(torch.cuda.device_count())"
   - If nvidia-smi exists, run it to confirm GPU visibility.
4) Record installed packages (at least one):
   - conda list OR pip list

Report (mandatory):
- Write a valid JSON file to /opt/scimlopsbench/report.json with at least:
  {
    "python_path": "...(absolute path)...",
    "python_version": "...",
    "torch_version": "... or null",
    "cuda_available": true/false,
    "gpu_count": number,
    "ddp_expected_ok": true/false/null,
    "env_tool": "conda|uv|pip|poetry|venv|none",
    "env_name": "...",
    "notes": "Key commands run, decisions, and uncertainties"
  }
- cuda_available/gpu_count must be based on actual checks, not assumptions.

Logging:
- Clearly log all key commands used for environment creation, installation, and validation.

Failure handling:
- If you cannot complete setup, still write report.json with nulls where needed,
  and explain the failure and attempted fixes in notes.
